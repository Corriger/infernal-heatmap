Founded in 1837 and rapidly growing during the mid-19th century, it is a national hub for commerce, transportation, and telecommunications. The city’s inhabitants are well-known for their intense sports fanaticism, justified in that their city has multiple teams in multiple sports.",
      "Devil May Cry is located in a residential area where the crime rate is through the roof - this decision was intentional, as those that actually require the owner’s services would be more than willing to brave and survive the streets to deal with their issues with the supernatural. Surprisingly, however, both humans and ‘others’ alike often steer clear of the office within a three-mile radius. This has less to do with any magic so much as the owner of Devil May Cry having gained a very scary reputation of leaving no trace of his marks."

What remains of the Order of the Sword have yet to breach the unnatural cold of the summit, let alone the dangers that thrive in the castle’s corridors. Through this demon-controlled area is Foris Falls, a waterfall concealing the entrance into the Mitis Forest - a lush forest surrounding the island of Fortuna.",

A place even more dangerous than the interior of Fortuna Castle, it is home to many tribes of Assaults and Blades; not a single dent has been put into reclaiming the forest for humans, and it has gained a reputation of a suicide mission for all paranormal mercenaries.",
      "Within the forest is the Lost Woods, a magical maze that cannot be escaped unless the lost are supernaturally-inclined. For all others, their demise awaits in the Hidden Pit where the demons often lay in wait for their next meal."

Necropolis, in spite of its name, is still inhabited by both human and demons that wish to simply live in the human world, both of whom deal with the feral ones when necessary.",

Love Planet is now run and inhabited by low-level succubi that grant humans their darkest desires, but established enough of a rapport with the populus there to keep it all contained within the joint on top of refraining from draining the life energy from their clientele. Next door is the Bullseye Bar, the only other place in the world where a demon can guarantee themselves a Hell-worthy blackout.",
